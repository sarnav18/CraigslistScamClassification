# Introduction
Online classified ads are an essential component of every business' digital marketing strategy. Due to the platform's enormous potential, fraudsters have been drawn to it, which has hampered the growth of online advertising. Because of this, spotting fake advertisements on such platforms is a critical problem that has to be efficiently filtered out. We'll be putting into practice a model that might assist us in spotting auto sales scams. We provide a creative approach to developing a scam detection program that will mark an advertisement as potentially fraudulent based on particular criteria. We have discovered characteristics that are most frequently found in fake advertising based on a few study publications, for example, phone and email not provided in the listings and price-based heuristics.

The project scope is limited to cars and pickup trucks which are one the most sold items on craigslist and the range of these items being sold is within 60-mile radius of Chicago. The goal of this project is multi-fold.

• First, we want to gain the trust of the audience and increase the credibility of the platform.

• Second, we want to be able to sell more quickly as genuine ads gather more traction from the buyers.

• Finally, we would be able to save people from getting scammed and increase awareness among the customers.
